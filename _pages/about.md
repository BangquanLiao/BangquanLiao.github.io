Hi there! I am a new PhD. student at Texas Tech University. I received my master's degree from the University of Pittsburgh in Bioengineering and my bachelor degree from the University of Iowa in Biomedical engineering. My research interest includes biomechanics, robotics and bioimaging & signals.

I was very fortunate to work in the [Laboratory of Ocular Biomechanics](https://www.ocularbiomechanics.com/) under the guidance of Dr. Ian Sigal. Thanks to his teachings that allowed me to enter the palace of science.

I am currently working in the [Cardiovascular Biomechanics Lab at Texas Tech University ](https://www.myweb.ttu.edu/minlliu/) under the guidance of Dr. Mingliang Liu, focusing on advancing the clinical prognosis and developing treatment strategies for cardiovascular diseases. 

You can find my CV here: [Resume - Bangquan](../assets/Resume - Bangquan_Eng.pdf).
