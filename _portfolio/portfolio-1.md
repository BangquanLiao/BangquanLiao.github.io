This is the research project in the Laboratory of Ocular Biomechanics. The ultimate goals is to analyze the mechanical and structural anistropies of the equatorial sclera. The equibiaxial tensile testing and polarized light microscopy was utilized to measure the stiffness and fiber orientation of equatorial sclera of 5 porcine eyes.The mismatch between anisotropies was not a surprise for this work.The causes underlying the mismatch between mechanical and structural anisotropies are not yet understood.One possible explanation could be differential collagen fiber crimp between orientations.It is also possible that there are directional variations in crosslinking, proteoglycan content or collagen type.
