This is my research project during my master's degree. The ultimate goals is to analyze the mechanical and structural anistropies of the equatorial sclera. The equibiaxial tensile testing and polarized light microscopy was utilized to measure the stiffness and fiber orientation of equatorial sclera of 5 porcine eyes.
