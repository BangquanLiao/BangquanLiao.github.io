Many soft tissues are mechanically anisotropic, meaning that their stiffness varies by orientation.Collagen fibers are the main load-bearing components of soft tissues, and therefore the macro-scale mechanical anisotropy arises from micro-scale structural anisotropy in the collagen fibers.Thus, it is frequently assumed that mechanical and structural anisotropies concur. But we found that those properties did not always concur with each others. Therefore, we want to systematically measure those two properties in this study.
